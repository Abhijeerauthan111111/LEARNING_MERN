        Introduction to equation of motion
    </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        In this article, we will learn how we can relate quantities <br> like velocity, time, acceleration and displacement provided the <br> acceleration remains constant. These relations arebr <br>collectively known as the equation of motion. There are three equations of motion. <br> There are three ways to derive the equation of motion <br> and here we are going to derive with the help of a graph. <br>
